# Forecasting-Workshop

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Sentosa Bank has conducted a trail mailing to 1000 randomly selected customers and offered them to buy two new investment products A & B. They plan a second mailing campaign specially targeted towards valuable customers.

Data Provided: The trial promotion results for 1000 customers are available, in order to identify customers who would buy one of the new products. Customer database consisting of 4000 customers has also been provided which gives us ‘potential score’ of each customer.

OBJECTIVE
Our aim is to identify 400 customers that will buy both or either of the products and hence estimate the expected profit from this optimal mailing list.
